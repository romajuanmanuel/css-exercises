/*  Make the element with both the `avatar` 
and `proportioned` classes 300 pixels wide,
 then give it a height so that it retains its original square
  proportions (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
* Make the element with both the `avatar` and `distorted`
 classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big
  as its width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).
